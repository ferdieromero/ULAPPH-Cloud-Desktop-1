### Thank you very much!
* Thank you to my brother who passed away while we are developing this cloud desktop. That is the reason why I closed the startup and release it under the company whom I've worked for 10+ years! He was the one who created the graphics and icons. Unfortunately, he also orphaned his son so kindly pray for him.
- Thank you as well to all the people who supported our social media campaigns through their likes and comments. Special mention to my wife who managed the start-up, my sister-in-law, school mates and even strangers who supported us in their own little ways.
- Thank you as well to Alessio for creating the Mac OS X like CSS user interface
- Thank you as well to Ed for creating the Javascript window manager
- Thank you so much to my current company who re-hired me and to my colleagues who supported the opensourcing of this simple piece of software
* Most of all, thank you to all the open source developers whom we have included the libraries inside the ULAPPH Cloud Desktop
