### Thank you very much!
* Thank you to my brother who passed away while we are developing this cloud desktop. He was the one who created the graphics and icons. Unfortunately, he also orphaned his son so kindly pray for him.
- Thank you as well to all the people who supported our social media campaigns through their likes and comments. Special mention to my wife who managed the start-up, my sister-in-law, school mates and even strangers who supported us in their own little ways.
* Most of all, thank you to all the open source developers whom we have included the libraries inside the ULAPPH Cloud Desktop
