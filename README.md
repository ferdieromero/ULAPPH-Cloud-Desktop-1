Introduction
------------

**ULAPPH Cloud Desktop** is a cloud desktop that runs in a browser such as Chrome, Opera and Firefox! It contains Javascript windowing system which displays contents in multiple **Windows**. The desktop can be configured to contain up to **1000 desktop categories** so you can organize your work, your personal, business and any information. It automatically generates contents into **slides**, **articles**, and **media** which are automatically saved in the Google cloud. It can be used by programmers to **develop Javascript applications** such as for Internet of Things (IOT) or execute **Golang** codes.  It saves data in the cloud which means your cloud desktop is available **anytime, anywhere and any device**. It works in laptops, desktops, Android/IOS devices as long as they have **Chrome, Opera or Firefox browsers** -- no installation required except the X-Frame-Ignore extension and Cross Origin **extension**. It was coded by an Electronics and Communications Engineer who loves programming! 

[ULAPPH Cloud Desktop](https://www.ulapph.com/) is a web-based desktop (webtop) for your online work, publishing, and development! ULAPPH is coined from word "ulap" which means cloud and PH which means it originated from the Philippines.

Installation
-------------

ULAPPH Cloud Desktop installation has two phases:
- **Phase 1** - Automatic creation of Google Project ID which creates your desired https://your-server-name.appspot.com. This covers STEP 1.
- **Phase 2** - Installing the ULAPPH Cloud Desktop source codes to the Google Project ID using the Excel-based installer. This covers STEP 2 to STEP 8.

### STEP 1: Automatically create your server name or project ID in Google Cloud
* Visit http://www.ulapph.com
	* Login using your Google or G-Suite account
	* Scroll down to see the App Engine Installer button
	* Click the App Engine installer button
	* Create your Google Project ID which can be the name of your business, your name or your pets name or accept the suggested name
	* Example: If I created "edwin-daen-vinas" as my project ID, the URL of my webtop will be: 
		* http://edwin-daen-vinas.appspot.com
* After the project ID is created in Google Cloud, you should be redirected to this page.

### STEP 2: Download the needed source codes
* Download the ULAPPH Cloud Desktop source codes which contain Golang, HTML, CSS, JS, etc
	* https://github.com/ulapph/ULAPPH-Cloud-Desktop

### STEP 3: Download the installer tool
* Download the Excel file with contains macro to automate installation or upgrades
	* https://github.com/ulapph/ULAPPH-Cloud-Desktop-VBA-Installer
* Configure the installer such as the email address, Google project ID and the installation paths
* Directory Structure must be correct
* You can create a main folder such as **C:\Users\your-folder-name\ulapph**
* Create a folder under the above named **ulapph-cloud-desktop** so you will have **C:\Users\your-folder-name\ulapph\ulapph-cloud-desktop**
* Download the sources from **https://github.com/Accenture/ULAPPH-Cloud-Desktop** to the **ulapph-cloud-desktop** folder
* Configure the installer with the correct paths above
* (Later, you can configure all other credentials -- sorry no docs yet about this)

### STEP 3b: First time installer setup
* For first time users which already has a new Google Project ID...
* Once you have opened the Excel tool and VBA is enabled, we can just find & replace the existing row
* Find and replace the owner email address from **demo.ulapph@gmail.com** to your **google-email-address@gmail.com**
* Find and replace the Google Project ID from **hornriver-leader** to **your-server-name**
* Make sure to check the correct directory structure and put it in the installer
*  Press F5 to install which calls appcfg.py or you can right click to access the installer menu
* Login if prompted by Ouath2 login and follow the screen instructions
* After a couple of minutes, your cloud desktop will be installed to your Google Project ID

### STEP 4: For existing installer, add row in the installer for new servers
* If the ULAPPH server is new, we need to add a row in the installer
* Update the row to contain the details of the new server
* Make sure you update the columns appropriately
* Press F5 to install which calls appcfg.py or you can right click to access the installer menu
* Login if prompted by Ouath2 login and follow the screen instructions
* After a couple of minutes, your cloud desktop will be installed to your Google Project ID

### STEP 5: Setup the cloud desktop start menu, sites server etc

#### Step 5a
* After installation is complete, please proceed with initial setup.
	* To setup a freshly installed desktop, you can access:
		* http://edwin-daen-vinas.appspot.com/admin-setup
	* Press the green power button to start setup. This will configure your fresh ULAPPH Cloud Desktop installation. Do this only once.
	* If you received the error "ERROR: SYSTEM_SEARCH_SETTINGS does not exist yet. Go to Admin Setup to Set Search Settings.~, please access the Admin Setup and set search settings.
		* https://your-server-name.appspot.com/admin-setup
		* Click "Set Search Settings"
		* STEP 1 must be left as is (set as N).
		* Enter below URL in STEP 2
			* https://ulapph-sites.appspot.com
		* Click Save
		* This now means that your desktop is connected to the central search server.
		
#### Step 5b
* If you have no Start Menu yet, you may configure your desktop to connect to the central menu
	* By default, your desktop will connect to the common start menu
	* To personalize it, perform the following steps:
		* Go to Admin Setup (/admin-setup)
		* Click "Edit System Top List Menu"
		* Enter the following text in the editor
			* #GET_REMOTE_DATA: http://ulapph-sites.appspot.com/media?FUNC_CODE=PLAY&MEDIA_ID=7&SID=TDSMEDIA-7
			* This means we will connect to the common menu stored in the central sites server
		* If you can't edit, make sure to check that the Read Only option is unchecked
		* Once saved, click the "Update Media" icon
			* File title: System Start Menu
			* File desc: System Top List Menu
		* Click the link "Set as SYSTEM Top List Menu"
		* Close the window
		* Click the reload icon in the main desktop toolbar
		
#### Step 5c
* Setup the desktop categories
	* By default, your desktop will not contain any desktop categories. You can define up to 1000 desktops!
	* To personalize it, perform the following steps:
		* Go to Admin Setup (/admin-setup)
		* Click "Edit Categories List"
		* Enter the below sample categories

	* Update the golang codes in **main.go** (this is the single Golang program that controls everything)
	* Update the static codes in **static** folder
* Then request a pull request if you want to contribute your changes

### ULAPPH Setup

You can setup ULAPPH Cloud Desktops as individual desktops connected to a central sites server. The central sites server will contain the shared menu, themes, monitoring, logging, etc. The central sites server and the individual cloud desktops are all running ULAPPH Cloud Desktops. There could be different central sites server. 

```sequence
server1.appspot.com -> sites.appspot.com: Conntects to central server
server2.appspot.com -> sites.appspot.com: Conntects to central server
installer.appspot.com -> server1.appspot.com: Auto creates project ID
local installer -> server1.appspot.com: Installs the software to cloud
```

### Thank you very much!
* Thank you to my brother who passed away while we are developing this cloud desktop. That is the reason why I closed the startup and release it under the company whom I've worked for 10+ years! He was the one who created the graphics and icons. Unfortunately, he also orphaned his son so kindly pray for him.
- Thank you as well to all the people who supported our social media campaigns through their likes and comments. Special mention to my wife who managed the start-up, my sister-in-law, school mates and even strangers who supported us in their own little ways.
- Thank you as well to Alessio for creating the Mac OS X like CSS user interface
- Thank you as well to Ed for creating the Javascript window manager
- Thank you so much to my current company who re-hired me and to my colleagues who supported the opensourcing of this simple piece of software
* Most of all, thank you to all the open source developers whom we have included the libraries inside the ULAPPH Cloud Desktop
