It is written in Golang or Go Language, Javascript, HTML, CSS and runs under Google Appengine. It is composed of different integrated technologies in order to provide a user experience similar to a desktop. This is not meant to replace the PC desktops. The cloud desktop is meant to be used by people who wants to work on an online desktop instead of local desktop.
